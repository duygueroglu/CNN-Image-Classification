# CNN-Image-Classification
This repo includes using cnn for image classification(data augmentation method).

Apply
=============

A cnn-based deep learning problem which has two class is solved.
* At first step, epoch was chosen as 30 in cnn-maxpool process.
* Then, train/validation accuracy graphic and train/validation loss graphic were produced.
  + After the 14. epoch, accuracy has increased considerably. As a result, memorizing started.
* At second step, this test was repeated with the data augmentation method.
* Then, this test was repeated with drop-out.
